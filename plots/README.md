## README plot

uniform folder contain plots for uniform refinement:

Deviations from initial conditions are oscillatory for the pair (RT1,DG0). This is due to spurious inertia-gravity waves oscillations arising from the non-optimal ratio between DOFs of velocity and height field. 

Deviations of physical invariants are of order 1e-13 for mass, absolute vorticity and esntrophy. 

Energy quickly decays in few iterations and is conserved for the rest of the simulation.


mov_mesh folder contain plots for 1+1D moving mesh method with monitor function based on exact gradient
